# NP Boneyard - Where Old Projects Go to Die

This is basically the code equivilent of posting pictures of myself as a child/teenager. I've found some old code kicking around on backup disks, and figured I might as well post it for posterity sake, or something.

## BinaryTexture/BinTex

A simple program to generate every 8-bit number in binary as a black/white image. This was used to generate a Cellular Automata Grid dancefloor using a single texture in Second Life.

## CAGenerator

A Game of Life implementation that wrote out to text files. Since implementing CA rules in LSL was out of the question due to both time and memory constraints, I had an outside server do it. This is the test code for that server.

## FFControl

My first teledildonics control code. Wrote this to control Force Feedback using DirectX to the SexBox controller.

## Hooky/HookySerial

Hooky was an input injection system for Second Life. At the time it was written, the only way to communicate with objects in world was XML-RPC. This converted joystick and sensor input to XML-RPC packets to control objects.

## TranceVibe

The first trancevibrator control code I ever wrote, in C#.

## nibbles-bike

Code for a game of nibbles/snake, mean to run on a Gameboy Advance with an Xport controller for sensor I/O.

## qEngine V2

There comes a time in every programmers life where they decide they need to program their own game engine, from scratch. This acts as something between a right of passage and good ol' teenage self-harming. I did this in 2002. It got as far as rendering bitmap fonts and a rotating cube.

# Second Life Projects

## NPControlBand

A general purpose control system to be worn as a bracelet. Basically my own version of the Multitool. Never really got very far with this.

## NPLabsDanceFloor

A 96x96 CA grid that could be used as a dancefloor, assuming you didn't mind spamming people with 96 texture position updates per frame.

## NPLabsKiosk

The code the drove the exhibit kiosks in the Second Life Nonpolynomial Labs building

## NPLabsScrollingSign

A sign that scrolled messages.

## NPLabsXMLRPCSatelliteControl

On top of the NPLabs building was a satellite that was supposed to be where XML-RPC messages were send and received. I was going to try to make a game out of it, this is how far I got.
