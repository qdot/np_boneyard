Welcome to Nonpolynomial Labs!

First off, please excuse our mess, we're currently working on building our new lab here in Alpha Centauri, so there
may be a bit of a mess for a while until we get everything up and running.

We are a research labratory dedicated to making new and interested control mechanisms for the game "First Life" 
by Linden Labs. Our HQ is open to the public, and we hope you have a great time looking around. You might even learn
a thing or two!

First Floor - Gift Shop

Want to show everyone that you've been to NP Labs? Pick up one of our shirts, or better yet, one of the gadgets that
our engineers has created! 

Second Floor - Museum

Visit our museum to see the research projects the lab has created over the years. We have made many incredible advances
in control of First Life objects, providing the Second Life community with a much more in-depth First Life play experience.

Third Floor - The Lab

Every tired scientist needs a place to get away to, and the lab is just the place to get away from all the circuits and 
scopes and listen to music that your computer would! Enjoy the best in IDM, Abstract Electronic, and Hard House streams, 
with live DJs and special events planned!

The Roof - The XML-RPCtellite

Visit the amazing XML-RPCtellite, our link to the First Life world! Watch it send packets out into the stratosphere, 
connecting our world with the game world of First Life. You can even take control of the satellite!

Have fun!
